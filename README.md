# CascadeTimer

CascadeTimer is a standalone, browser-based application for creating and running series of sequential timers. When one timer completes, the next one in the sequence automatically begins. It's designed for workflows, interval training, study sessions (like the Pomodoro technique), and any scenario requiring a chain of timed events.

This application runs entirely in the browser using JavaScript and jQuery, with no server-side backend required. It can be run locally or hosted on static site platforms like GitHub Pages.

## Features

*   **Timer Cascades:** Create multiple, independent series of timers.
*   **Custom Timers:** Each timer in a cascade can be individually named and have its duration set (days, hours, minutes, seconds).
*   **Sequential Operation:** Timers run one after another, with audio and optional text-to-speech notifications.
*   **Looping:** Cascades can be set to repeat automatically upon completion.
*   **Runtime Controls:** Start, pause, skip to the next/previous timer.
*   **Customizable Sounds:** Assign different notification sounds to different timers, or set a default for a cascade. Mute options are also available.
*   **Save & Load:** Save all your timer cascades to a single `.zip` file and load them back in any browser.
*   **Standalone:** All dependencies can be downloaded locally for offline use.
